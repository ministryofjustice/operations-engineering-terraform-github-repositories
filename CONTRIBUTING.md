## Contributing code

### Terraform Versions

We use Hashicorp [Terraform](https://www.terraform.io/) to deliver infrastructure as code.

We stay up to date with the latest version of Terraform, but control the version of the Terraform Providers in use.

### Tests

Our versioned Terraform modules have unit tests; these are written using [Terratest](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/gruntwork-io/terratest#section-readme) and Go.

Your branch should ensure that changes you have made are reflected in the tests, and that these unit tests pass before raising a pull request.

A GitHub Action will automatically run tests against your pull request once you have raised it.

### Versioning

Where appropriate, versioning is based on your commit message using [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/).

When raising a pull request please provide context so that your changes are easier to understand.

### Release

Releases are actioned by the Operations Engineering team.
